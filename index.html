	  <h2>About Me</h2>
	  <p>
		I’m from NSW and am currently studying online due to coronavirus. 
		As pets I keep a fish tank filled with guppies and my dog who is nearly 17 years old, I’ve had him since I was six after begging for a puppy every birthday since I could talk.<br /> <br />
		Outside of my pets I enjoy reading, playing games with friends and occasionally working on little games of my own. 
		I’ve worked on and off in construction since I was 16 however as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized It’s not a career path I wish to continue down.<br /><br />

	  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
	  <p>
		I am studying IT because I’ve always been interested in tech, as a child I would get in trouble for downloading this or that on the family computer. 
		I remember being caught in the study at 2am one night after sneaking in to play a videogame on the computer.<br /><br /> 
		I also used to create very simple little robots using parts given to me by my grandfather (electrical engineer) and parts I tore out of other things like remote controlled cars. 
		My uncle is a systems administrator and we made a very simple website in the mid-2000s which at the time I thought was incredible. 
		These days I enjoy making games in unity and learning more about programming.	
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I’ve chosen to study at RMIT because they were the only ones offering the pre-requisite courses I need during the 4th study period so I can start my bachelors locally at the beginning of next year.
		I’m hoping to learn about what will be expected of me as a university student and about the professional IT industry to help my planned career.
	  </p><br /><br />

	  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
	  <p>
		I’ve learnt some programming and have messed about on the unity engine creating fun little projects and games.
		I find programming to be far more creative than it gets credit for and I enjoy solving problems using it.<br /><br /> 
		I would like to pursue this further and working in software would be my ideal job in the IT industry as I think it would present me with new challenges and be a rewarding career.<br /><br />

		<img src="job.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Job Ad" height="1200" width="500" /><br /><br />
		This job seems to be relatively broad regarding the type of software I would be working on.  I think it would be a challenging experience that would allow me to work on the front end and back end of projects.<br /><br />
		This role would require a lot more experience and education than I currently have. I think I would need to complete my bachelors and get several years’ experience in the field, particularly in backend web applications.<br /><br />
		Currently I only have some relevant TAFE courses under my belt and since my work has been in the trades that wouldn’t be relevant outside of the experience working in teams.
		I can achieve these requirements through further university level study and hopefully get an internship that leads me to employment in the industry.

	  <h2>Profile</h2>
	  <h4>Myers-Briggs</h4>  
	  <p>
		My Myers-Briggs test results from https://www.16personalities.com/ put me as a logician.  
		I’m not a big believer in short questionnaires defining who we are as individuals so in truth these results don’t mean much to me.<br /><br /> 
		I will try and work on some of the weaknesses I see in myself that match this personality type and I think for group work ideally a diverse number of personalities would help us to combine our strengths and mitigate our weaknesses.<br /><br />

	  <h4>Learning Style</h4>
	  <p>
		The results of my online learning style test at What's Your Learning Style? (educationplanner.org) placed me as a tactile learner. 
		I can certainly agree with this one as I often struggle with listening to two-hour lectures without anything for me to do but listen. <br /><br />
		I learn far better when given regular tasks and assignments to do and I find assignments etc. far easier If I’m first given a chance to “take things apart and put them back together again” from a related or similar project. 
		For example, practice exams or the previous years exams are very useful for me and I’ve always done better when provided with them.<br /><br />
		In teams I think this could be useful as I’m willing to be pointed in the direction of something and then to jump in and try to learn it by doing it.<br /><br />

	  <h4>Career Path</h4>
	  <p>
		The last test I did was an ideal career test at CareerExplorer. 
		The results were pretty much inline with what I had decided myself and all of them are in the IT field. 
		This is good for working in teams as I have a genuine interest in the projects we will be working on.<br /><br />
